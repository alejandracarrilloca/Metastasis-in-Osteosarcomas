## Problem Statement

Osteosarcoma is the most common cancer among adolescents and young adults, and it represents the most frequent primary malignant bone tumor in this population. It mainly affects long bones during periods of rapid growth, such as the distal femur, proximal tibia, and humerus. Although conventional treatment includes combined surgery and chemotherapy—with significant improvements in survival for patients without disseminated disease—**pulmonary metastasis** remains the leading cause of death. This form of dissemination occurs in approximately 20% of cases at the time of diagnosis and can develop in up to 40% during follow-up. The presence of metastasis is associated with a significantly poorer prognosis and a high recurrence rate, highlighting the urgent need to better understand the molecular mechanisms driving metastatic progression.

At the molecular level, metastasis involves a series of changes in **gene expression**, including pathways related to migration, adhesion, and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. However, the **molecular biomarkers** associated with these processes are not yet fully characterized, which limits the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Studying gene expression profiles associated with cellular invasion and migration is crucial to:

- Identify **biomarkers** that enable more accurate prognoses.
- Understand the molecular mechanisms of metastasis.

This project aims to **replicate and validate** the findings of the referenced article using a bioinformatics pipeline for RNA-seq analysis and differential expression analysis. Doing so will allow us to explore new hypotheses and generate more robust evidence for future clinical applications.
